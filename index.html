        <h2>About Electrobiotechlab</h2>
        <p>Our lab is dedicated to innovative research in electrobiochemical technology across biotechnological, agricultural, and environmental fields. We strive for sustainability and impact through cutting-edge research and applications.</p>
        <p>Explore the sections above to learn more about our research projects, meet our team, view our publications, and get in touch with us.</p>
        <p>In our lab, we explore the potential of electroactive microbes to address environmental challenges in practical and sustainable ways. Our research focuses on bioelectrochemical systems and microbial fuel cells (MFCs), with a particular interest in microbes like cable bacteria.</p>
        <p>These bacteria are especially intriguing due to their ability to conduct electricity across long distances, which holds promise for applications in carbon capture and water quality improvement. By studying these unique capabilities, we aim to develop approaches that can help mitigate pollution in marine and terrestrial ecosystems.</p>
        <p>We are also committed to integrating cultural heritage in our work, exemplified by our collaboration with indigenous communities to honor traditions, such as naming a newly discovered species of cable bacteria. Beyond cable bacteria, our lab is exploring other electroactive microbes with potential for environmental remediation and resource recovery.</p>
        <p>Through this work, we hope to contribute modestly to environmental sustainability, advancing solutions that align with natureâ€™s own processes.</p>
