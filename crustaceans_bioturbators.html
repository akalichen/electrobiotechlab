<!-- Taxonomy Section -->
<section id="taxonomy">
    <h2>Taxonomy and Classification</h2>
    <p>*Upogebia pugettensis*, commonly known as the Blue Mud Shrimp, belongs to the family Upogebiidae within the order Decapoda. Originally described as *Gebia pugettensis* in 1852, it was later reclassified under the genus *Upogebia*.</p>

<!-- Morphology Section -->
<section id="morphology">
    <h2>Morphology and Physical Characteristics</h2>
    <p>*Upogebia pugettensis* can grow up to 100 mm in length, with northern populations typically larger than their southern counterparts. It has a light blue-green to deep olive-brown color, with a characteristic large, tridentate rostrum and short eyestalks. The body is divided into a cephalothorax and abdomen, with five pairs of thoracic appendages and three pairs of maxillipeds.</p>

<!-- Ecological Role Section -->
<section id="ecological-role">
    <h2>Ecological Role in Tidal Sediments</h2>
    <p>As a bioturbator, *Upogebia pugettensis* plays a critical role in aerating sediment and recycling nutrients in estuarine ecosystems. It constructs firm, permanent U- or Y-shaped burrows that are up to 46 cm deep, lined with mucus for stability. These burrows provide shelter for various commensal species and help facilitate nutrient exchange and decomposition processes in the sediment.</p>

<!-- Behavior Section -->
<section id="behavior">
    <h2>Feeding and Behavioral Characteristics</h2>
    <p>*Upogebia pugettensis* has been suggested to be a filter-feeding detritivore, drawing water into its burrow and trapping suspended particles using long setae on its pereopods. This filtering activity contributes to controlling phytoplankton density in estuarine waters. The species is known to exhibit ecosystem engineering behavior by affecting sediment composition, nutrient cycling, and community structure within its habitat.</p>

<!-- Conservation and Threats Section -->
<section id="conservation">
    <h2>Conservation and Environmental Impact</h2>
    <p>Populations of *Upogebia pugettensis* have been impacted by the invasive parasitic isopod *Orthione griffenis*, introduced to the Pacific coast in the 1980s. This parasite attaches to the gills of the Blue Mud Shrimp, reducing its reproductive capacity and contributing to population declines. The loss of *U. pugettensis* can lead to changes in sediment stability and nutrient availability, impacting the broader estuarine ecosystem.</p>

    <h2>Research on Upogebia pugettensis Burrow Microbiome</h2>
    <p>Our research focuses on the unique microbial communities within the burrow linings of <i>Upogebia pugettensis</i>, the Blue Mud Shrimp. These burrows are Y-shaped structures that extend into anoxic zones of the sediment, creating a distinct microenvironment influenced by the shrimp's bioirrigation activities. Through these actions, the burrows act as conduits for oxygen, sustaining suboxic and oxic conditions even in otherwise anoxic sediments. This dynamic environment supports diverse microbial communities, including filamentous cable bacteria (CB), which play a role in electrogenic sulfur oxidation and other biogeochemical processes.</p>

    <p>The primary goals of our research are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Understanding Feeding Patterns:</strong> We examine the microbiome composition within burrow sediments to determine how <i>Upogebia pugettensis</i> sustains itself through filter-feeding and nutrient acquisition. Our studies have shown that bacterial biomass from these burrow linings likely constitutes a significant part of the shrimp's diet. The microbiome shared between the shrimp and its commensal bivalve, <i>Neaeromya rugifera</i>, indicates a symbiotic relationship and potential reliance on sediment bacteria for nourishment.</li>

        <li><strong>Unraveling Infection Chains:</strong> We investigate the parasitic infection by the bopyrid isopod <i>Orthione griffenis</i>, which has significantly impacted <i>Upogebia pugettensis</i> populations. Our research aims to explore how the microbial community within the shrimp's burrows influences its susceptibility to parasitic infections and to identify possible intervention points for managing this parasite's spread. By studying the microbial interactions and conditions within these burrows, we aim to gain insights that could aid in the conservation of this ecologically important crustacean species.</li>
